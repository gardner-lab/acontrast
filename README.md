# Welcome (i.e. what does this do?)

This is a MATLAB toolbox for computing acoustic contrast scores using either the contour transform (requires adding the [acontour repository](https://github.com/jmarkow/acontour) to your MATLAB path) or the derivative of the amplitude envelope.  To install simply add the base and "helpers" directory to your MATLAB path.  To verify the installation run the install script, you should see the following output: ![Demo output](/acontrast_demo.png?raw=true "Demo output") 

Parameters are passed as parameter/value pairs (see demo script for example).
